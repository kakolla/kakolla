### note:

I wanted to create this notes section where I keep all the things I explore as
sort of an archive to look back later on. There's also a few more reasons as to why 
I'm documenting my stuff.

I really like teaching, and also I find that a lot of sources out there don't really
teach well. A good amount of content out there simply states information, and it's 
often up to the reader to try to make the connections and understand the 'why.'

When I learn (and I believe most of us do this), I usually need examples and a reason for
why the thing I'm learning works the way it does. Otherwise I'm very prone to go down 
rabbit holes or get stuck. That's why I wanted to document some of the connections I make
as I learn, and maybe it might be helpful for some people out there.

**AND disclaimer:** I will be wrong. I will make mistakes. And I will need to be criticized. 
So please do, but keep in mind this is where I'll explore random stuff and might be wrong on 
some parts. But I will try to keep it as accurate to the best of my understanding.

peace
